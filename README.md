# UFOs

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, we will add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results

Filter Example:

To perform a search on the webpage, users will need to input at least one criterion under the "Filter Search" form. For example, if user want to find all sightings in the "US" with a "circle" shape, they will need to type in "us" in the "Enter a Country" input box and press Enter on their keyboard or click anywhere outside the input box and "circle" in the "Enter a Shape" input box and press Enter on their keyboard or click anywhere outside the input box. 

## Summary

### Drawback
One drawback for this new design is users do not know all the available options that can be accepted in the "Filter Search" input boxes. For example, if users want to know sightings for a country in Asia, they would need to shift through all the table rows to find the abbreviations for the Asian country they want then type the abbreviation in the "Enter a Country" input box. 

### Recommendations

1. One recommendation for further development is to change some of the input boxes to a drop-down menu that shows the available options and user is able to filter through that menu. This is helpful for city, state, country, and shape filters as the options are limited and prevents user-errors of typing in manually. 

2. Another recommendation for further development is to have more data inside in the data.js file. The data in this project only ranged from 1/1/2010 - 1/13/2010.
